# <center>TicTacToe-Minimax</center>

This repository contains the minimax algorithm applied on a game of TicTacToe. 
## Minimax :

    The Minimax algorithm is an algorithm used in game theory to minimize the
    maximum possible loss in a given scenario (source : Wikipedia)
<br/><br/>
* The main limitation of Minimax algorithm is that for complex games such as chess,
it gets much slower and is not optimal. So in such cases better heuristics and alpha-beta pruning is used to prune the search tree and make the algorithm run faster.
